								<h3>Firmware Development Intern - Seagate Technology, Longmont, CO</h3>
								<p>During my time as an Intern at Seagate, I worked in the Dataflow and Performance team under Mr. Richard Harris. My worked involved firmware development, coding and debugging. 
									Some of the major projects included developing Unit Tests and creating Python Scripts.
									I developed unit tests for Report Zone Domain command for zone domain devices where the goal was to provide test coverage for known defect escapes in the code path and validate that the firmware 
									performed as expected depending on the types of inputs passed.
									It provided handling for corner cases and out of bound cases following spec compliance. I also worked on creating python scripts for unit test automation which aided in Unit
									test development to help decrease the time and effort for developers and simplified setting up of CMake project. Through this experience, I gained 
									experience with zone domain devices and how they are configured, googletest framework and fake function framework, Perforce as a version control system, CMake tool to build native build tool files,
									professional skills of task management using JIRA and SBM, python fundamentals and python scripting<br/> Some of the project outcomes included:
									<br/> * Refactoring report zone domain command with more than 65 tests, detecting almost 3 errors. 
									<br/> * Refresh TestDoubles unit test project files from the master source file.
									<br/> * Unit test CMake project template creation and reducing developer's time in setting of project by 50%.
